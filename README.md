PrecinctTool
============

This project was written in 2011 as an example of using the ArcGIS Python API in order to process precinct data and load it into static webpages. This was created as a project for GIS 540 when I was in graduate school at NC State.

The code is gross, and I have no plans to update it, but feel free to take a look through it if this may be useful to you. Essentially, it takes data about voting precincts in Orange County, NC, and creates a set of static HTML files to tell visitors some additional information about each precinct.

The project was created around ArcGIS 9.x; I assume it may still work with more recent versions, but no guarantees.
